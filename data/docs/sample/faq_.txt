Q: How should a student create a monthly budget?
A: Start by listing all monthly income (allowances, part-time job), then fixed expenses (rent, phone), then variable expenses (food, transport). Allocate a portion to savings (aim for 10% if possible). Track expenses for 1-2 months and adjust.

Q: What is an emergency fund and how much should I save?
A: An emergency fund covers unexpected expenses (urgent repairs, medical, sudden travel). For students, a small goal like $500–$1,000 is a good starting point.

Q: Should students invest while studying?
A: Investing can be beneficial if you have an emergency fund and can tolerate market risk. Start small with low-cost index funds or fractional shares. Prioritize high-interest debt before investing aggressively.

Q: How does student loan interest work?
A: Interest accrues on the outstanding principal at the lender's stated rate. If possible, make interest-only payments during school to avoid capitalization (interest added to principal).

Q: Where can I find scholarships?
A: Look at university scholarship pages, government portals, and scholarship search engines. Apply early and tailor each application.
